## About

You probably are wondering what kodekage means? I gave it meaning and from my perspective it means *"I'm responsible for my code"*.
I'm the lord of my codeland and oversee it's readability, maintainability, cleanliness etc. I'm not a perfect kage but I learn from
the complaints of my people (error logs and stack traces) and keep the god's happy (Runtime engine). 

> **kodekage** is an aliase I adopted after seeing the great ninja war in the Naruto anime series which is my favorite.
